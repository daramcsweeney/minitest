# minitest

Instructions: <br />
run q minitest.q in directory where script is saved <br />
Type totalavg in script to get total average per accountGroup <br />
Type rollingavg in script to get rolling average per accountGroup <br />
Feed 1 table is called feed and feed 3 table is called feed1, qsql queries can be run on them <br />
Further comments are included within the script <br />
<br />
Issues: <br />
Because of the way I started the test, it was quite difficult to break the script into 3 deliverables due to the .z.ts function and inserting to tables <br />
I also couldn't figure out how to format/parse JSON so couldnt complete feed 2 <br /> 
<br />
